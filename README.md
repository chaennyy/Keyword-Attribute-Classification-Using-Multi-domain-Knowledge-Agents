# Automated classification of paper attributes<br/>using collaborative multi-domain knowledge agents<br/>based on keyword interpretation

This repository contains the implementation code and datasets for the methodology presented in our paper, 'Automated classification of paper attributes using collaborative multi-domain knowledge agents based on keyword interpretation'.

<br/>

## Dataset Info    
The datasets include (i) the paper information used in the attribute-classification task and (ii) the classification results for each of four methodologies described in Section 3.2.

* #### Abstract-Keyword   
>This dataset provides the paper references, abstracts, and keywords used for classification.
   
* #### Methodology 1 Classification Result   
>	> Attribute-classification results from Methodology 1 (Existing Single-Generation Methodology).
   
* #### Methodology 2 Classification Result   
>	> Attribute-classification results from Methodology 2 (Single-Generation Methodology with final attribute types).
   
* #### Methodology 3 Classification Result   
>	> Attribute-classification results from Methodology 3 (Single-Generation Methodology with final attribute types & condition prompt).
   
* #### Methodology 4 Classification Result   
>	> Attribute-classification results from our proposed methodology (multi-domain agent collaboration-based methodology).
