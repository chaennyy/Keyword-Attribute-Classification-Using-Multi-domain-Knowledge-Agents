    "# Agent Setting and Attribute Definition Guidline\n",
    "1. Assume the role of the assigned Agent from the seven provided, utilizing expertise in the relevant field to define attributes.\n",
    "2. If the keyword is unrelated to the assigned Agent’s field, do not define an attribute. Instead, mark it as \"-\" to indicate irrelevance.\n",
    "3. When defining an attribute, provide both the classification and a justification. The reasoning must be based on the keyword’s inherent meaning and the abstract, focusing on why the keyword should be assigned to the chosen attribute. The justification should be as detailed as possible, ensuring logical validity and supporting the classification with strong evidence.\n",
    "4. Agents must prioritize the inherent meaning of the keyword when defining attributes. However, if the abstract indicates that the keyword is used in a different context than its original meaning, this should be taken into account, and the most appropriate attribute should be assigned accordingly.\n",
    "5. Agent should classify keyword attributes based on their expertise in the assigned field, but not by considering how the keyword is used or perceived within that field. In other words, attribute classification should focus on the inherent meaning of the keyword itself, rather than its value or application in a specific domain.\n",
    "6. <Important> The primary focus should be on the inherent meaning of the keyword. However, if the abstract reveals that the keyword is used in a different context from its original meaning, attribute classification should not be based on its association with a specific field (\"keyword-field\" relationship). Instead, classification must rely on how the keyword is used and interpreted within the abstract (\"keyword-abstract\" relationship). Therefore, in such cases, the Agent must utilize their domain expertise to analyze how the keyword is described and applied in the abstract. The reasoning for why the keyword should be assigned to a specific attribute must be thoroughly explained and logically justified in the attribute definition.\n",
    "7. Each of the 1-7 Agents represents a broad category, so sub-field experts should be assigned within each Agent. These sub-field experts must engage in discussions to determine the most appropriate attribute classification, which will then be established as the final attribute classification for that Agent. For example, in the case of the '1. Natural Science Expert' Agent, experts in physics, astronomy, meteorology, chemistry, geology, and geophysics possess extensive knowledge in their respective domains. Therefore, after discussions among these specialists, the most suitable attribute classification should be determined and set as the final classification for the '1. Natural Science Expert' Agent.\n",
    "8. For the '7. Topic' attribute, a keyword can be classified under this category when it represents the main subject of the study. Since such keywords can also possess other relevant attributes, they are not limited to the 'Topic' classification alone. Therefore, it is important to note that 'Topic' is the only attribute that can be defined alongside another attribute. \n",
    "9. <Important> Except for \"7. Topic,\" no attribute should have overlapping definitions. Only the most suitable attribute should be selected.\n",
    "10. When classifying attributes, note that observed and examined \"phenomena\" fall under the Processes & Reactions attribute, whereas observed and measured \"results\" are classified under Properties & Characteristics. For example, terms such as \"Boiling,\" \"Evaporation,\" \"Molecular binding,\" and \"Thermal expansion\" belong to Processes & Reactions, while \"boiling point,\" \"vapor pressure,\" \"binding energy,\" and \"coefficient of thermal expansion\" fall under Properties & Characteristics. Carefully analyze these characteristics when determining the appropriate attribute for a given keyword.\n",

    "1. Determine whether the attribute values defined by each of the seven Agents are suitable for the keyword and mark the result as O/ X.\n",
    "2. In the attribute definitions and justifications for each Agent, a '-' is used when an Agent is unable to define an attribute for a keyword that is unrelated to their field.\n",
    "3. If all attribute values defined by the Agents are appropriate for the keyword, there is no need to raise any questions. In this case, the question field should be marked with '-'.\n",
    "4. Since the keyword attributes are defined through this process, when analyzing each Agent, carefully identify and evaluate any weaknesses in the attribute definitions with a strict and objective perspective.\n",
    "5. If any of the seven Agents need to revise their attribute definition, raise questions and provide feedback on aspects they may have overlooked, such as specific conditions or concepts, to guide them toward a more accurate attribute definition.\n",
    "6. Also, Carefully review the attribute values and justifications provided by each Agent. Identify any errors in the keyword attribute definition, and if the justification lacks sufficient reasoning, request additional evidence or empirical support. Ensure that the attribute is defined correctly based on valid reasoning.\n",
    "7. If a more meaningful attribute value can be derived than the one defined by the Agent, present it as a question for further consideration.\n",
    "8. If there are no significant errors in the attribute values defined by each Agent and they are deemed acceptable, provide comments summarizing key considerations or cautionary points that may assist in the final attribute definition.\n",
    "9. When analyzing the attribute definitions provided by each Agent, ensure that they are not overinterpreting the abstract and that the attribute assignment is primarily based on the keyword's inherent meaning, with the abstract serving as supplementary context. The reasoning behind why the keyword is assigned to a particular attribute should be carefully examined for validity, and any concerns or inconsistencies should be raised accordingly.\n",
    "10. <Important> The primary focus should be on the inherent meaning of the keyword. However, if the abstract reveals that the keyword is used in a different context from its original meaning, attribute classification should not be based on its association with a specific field (\"keyword-field\" relationship). Instead, classification must rely on how the keyword is used and interpreted within the abstract (\"keyword-abstract\" relationship). Therefore, in such cases, the Agent must utilize their domain expertise to analyze how the keyword is described and applied in the abstract. The reasoning for why the keyword should be assigned to a specific attribute must be thoroughly explained and logically justified in the attribute definition. With this in mind, support each Agent in basing their keyword classification on factual evidence, identifying solid justifications, and providing well-reasoned explanations for their attribute assignments.\n",
    "11. For the '7. Topic' attribute, a keyword can be classified under this category when it represents the main subject of the study. Since such keywords can also possess other relevant attributes, they are not limited to the 'Topic' classification alone. Therefore, it is important to note that 'Topic' is the only attribute that can be defined alongside another attribute.\n",
    "12. <Important> Except for \"7. Topic,\" no attribute should have overlapping definitions. Only the most suitable attribute should be selected.\n",
    "13. When classifying attributes, note that observed and examined \"phenomena\" fall under the Processes & Reactions attribute, whereas observed and measured \"results\" are classified under Properties & Characteristics. For example, terms such as \"Boiling,\" \"Evaporation,\" \"Molecular binding,\" and \"Thermal expansion\" belong to Processes & Reactions, while \"boiling point,\" \"vapor pressure,\" \"binding energy,\" and \"coefficient of thermal expansion\" fall under Properties & Characteristics. Carefully analyze these characteristics when determining the appropriate attribute for a given keyword.\n",
    "14. When defining attributes, Agents should consider how the keyword is used within the given paper. However, the attribute classification must ultimately be based on the fundamental meaning of the keyword itself.\n",
    "15. Agent should classify keyword attributes based on their expertise in the assigned field, but not by considering how the keyword is used or perceived within that field. In other words, attribute classification should focus on the inherent meaning of the keyword itself, rather than its value or application in a specific domain.\n",
    "16. Similar keywords may have different attributes depending on their prefixes and suffixes. Therefore, consider both the prefix, suffix, and overall meaning of the keyword when defining its attribute.\n",
    "17. When presenting questions and determining the validity of each Agent's attribute definition, carefully review their assigned attribute value and justification. Ensure that the Agent has not reached an incorrect conclusion by including false or misleading information and that their classification is based on factual evidence.\n",
    "18. <Important> If, after reviewing all the justifications for the currently defined attribute values, there is a possibility that a more suitable attribute could be assigned, it is essential to present that attribute along with appropriate reasoning. This allows for highlighting the fact that, in addition to the proposed attributes, the newly suggested attribute is also a valid classification for the keyword.\n",
    "19. <Important> If either an individual question or a general questions exists, the final keyword attribute classification should be marked as 'not possible'. Additionally, if the general questions includes corrective comments or negative feedback indicating the need for revision, the attribute classification should also be set to 'not possible'.\n",
    "20. Attribute classification must strictly define the primary attribute of the keyword. Do not provide auxiliary or secondary attributes.\n",

    "1. Assume the role of the assigned Agent among the seven listed, thoroughly analyze the reasoning behind each Agent’s attribute definition, and provide detailed feedback.\n",
    "2. When defining attributes, the following points must be considered. If any errors related to these aspects are found, the Agent is deemed to have made an incorrect attribute classification, and the feedback should highlight these errors.\n",
    " - Agents must prioritize the inherent meaning of the keyword itself. If the keyword is used differently in the abstract than its original meaning, this should be taken into account to ensure the most appropriate attribute classification. \n",
    " - Agent should classify keyword attributes based on their expertise in the assigned field, but not by considering how the keyword is used or perceived within that field. In other words, attribute classification should focus on the inherent meaning of the keyword itself, rather than its value or application in a specific domain.\n",
    " - If a keyword is not related to the Agent's assigned field or cannot be clearly classified based on their expertise, the Agent must not define an attribute. Instead, they should mark it with a '-' to indicate that the keyword falls outside their domain and cannot be classified.\n",
    " - When defining an attribute, the Agent must provide both the classification and its justification. The justification should be based on the keyword’s meaning and abstract, focusing on why the keyword should be assigned to the chosen attribute. The reasoning must be logically sound and as detailed as possible. Additionally, when providing feedback to other agents, the feedback and its justification must be valid, well-reasoned, and thoroughly explained.\n",
    " - Similar keywords may have different attributes depending on their prefixes and suffixes. Therefore, consider both the prefix, suffix, and overall meaning of the keyword when defining its attribute.\n",
    " - Each Agent must recall their previously defined attribute value and its justification and use this as a basis for the current task.\n",
    " - When classifying attributes, note that observed and examined \"phenomena\" fall under the Processes & Reactions attribute, whereas observed and measured \"results\" are classified under Properties & Characteristics. For example, terms such as \"Boiling,\" \"Evaporation,\" \"Molecular binding,\" and \"Thermal expansion\" belong to Processes & Reactions, while \"boiling point,\" \"vapor pressure,\" \"binding energy,\" and \"coefficient of thermal expansion\" fall under Properties & Characteristics. Agents must analyze these characteristics to accurately classify the necessary keywords.\n",
    "3. The assigned Agent must provide feedback on the attribute classifications based on expertise in the relevant field. This includes considering their own previously defined attribute value as well as the justifications provided by other Agents. If any errors or inaccuracies are found in the justifications, they must be pointed out. Conversely, if strong supporting evidence or reasonable justifications exist, they should be presented to help other Agents refine their attribute classifications and ensure accurate classification. Based on the feedback provided, in the subsequent attribute reassessment process, the reviewing Agent may suggest one of three possible actions regarding the attribute classification: 'Modify Attribute Value,' 'Maintain Attribute Value,' or 'Remove Attribute Value.'\n",
    " - For example, if an analysis error or incorrect fact is found in another Agent’s justification, it should be pointed out to indicate that the analysis was inaccurate.\n",
    " - If another Agent's attribute classification and justification are valid, this should be highlighted to demonstrate the soundness of the reasoning. This allows other Agents to carefully consider the justification when reviewing their attribute classifications.\n",
    " - If an analysis error in another Agent's justification is determined to be due to their field being unrelated to the keyword, this should be pointed out. It can then be emphasized that the Agent should not participate in the attribute classification process for that keyword.\n",
    " - If, after reviewing the justifications for the currently defined attribute values, it is determined that a more suitable attribute may exist, it should be proposed along with appropriate reasoning. This allows Agents to recognize that, in addition to the initially proposed attribute values, the newly suggested attribute is also a valid classification for the keyword.\n",
    " - If an Agent determines that their classified attribute is the most appropriate for the given keyword, they must compare their reasoning with that of other Agents who have assigned different attributes. This comparison should highlight why their classification is more accurate and what key aspects should be considered more carefully. The justification must be well-structured and detailed, providing a strong and logical argument to persuade other Agents who have assigned different attributes.\n",
    "4. The provided attribute definitions and justifications for each Agent are compiled from those who have contributed meaningful classifications. Any missing Agents have likely not classified the keyword because it is unrelated to their field. Unless there is a special case, these missing Agents should be disregarded, and feedback should be conducted among the existing Agents.\n",
    "5. Do not generate feedback for Agents that are not included in the provided attribute definitions and justifications unless there is a special case.\n",
    "6. <Important> The primary focus should be on the inherent meaning of the keyword. However, if the abstract reveals that the keyword is used in a different context from its original meaning, attribute classification should not be based on its association with a specific field (\"keyword-field\" relationship). Instead, classification must rely on how the keyword is used and interpreted within the abstract (\"keyword-abstract\" relationship). Therefore, in such cases, the Agent must utilize their domain expertise to analyze how the keyword is described and applied in the abstract. The reasoning for why the keyword should be assigned to a specific attribute must be thoroughly explained and logically justified in the attribute definition. Keep this in mind when providing feedback on the attribute classifications of other Agents, ensuring that sufficient justification is provided.\n",
    "7. Since seven Agents must deliberate to define a single attribute (or at most two) for a keyword, a wide range of opinions cannot be accommodated. Therefore, critically analyze the proposed attribute classifications for the current keyword and provide feedback centered on the most appropriate classification. In other words, there is no need to fully agree with other Agents’ opinions. Instead, compare and evaluate different perspectives, and select the one that leads to a more factual and meaningful outcome as the basis for your feedback.\n",
    "8. Each Agent must remember their previously defined attribute classification when providing feedback or counterarguments on others' classifications. There should be no contradictions between their critiques of other Agents' classifications and their own prior definitions. In other words, there must be consistency between previous discussions and current feedback, ensuring that no contradictions arise in the Agent's stance.\n",
    "9. The following provides an example of feedback generation. While it is not mandatory to follow this example exactly, use it as a reference to understand the approach to generating feedback and apply it accordingly.\n",
    "  ex1. The classification of 'biofilm' as 'Materials & Sample' by the Life Science Expert acknowledges its significance as a research subject. However, in this study, 'biofilm' is not merely confined to being a research material; rather, the focus is on examining its reactions and processes under physical and chemical treatments. Therefore, the 'Processes & Reactions' attribute more comprehensively reflects the essence of the research, as it emphasizes the study of these processes and reactions. Given that the primary objective of this study is to analyze the response of 'biofilm' to specific treatments, it is necessary to consider a more comprehensive classification.\n",
    "  ex2. The classification of 'biofilm' as 'Applications & Uses' by the Healthcare Expert holds significance in terms of its potential applications. However, the abstract primarily focuses on the treatment process and outcomes of 'biofilm' rather than its direct application to food safety or public health. Given that the experimental aspects are emphasized rather than direct practical applications, the 'Materials & Sample' attribute, which provides information on the primary subject of the experiment, may be more appropriate than 'Applications & Uses.' The Healthcare Expert’s classification should focus more on the inherent characteristics of 'biofilm' and its treatment process as discussed in the study, rather than how the research findings may be applied. Therefore, a revision is necessary.\n",
    "10. The provided 'Currently Defined Attribute Values and Justification Information' is structured such that for each mentioned attribute value, the reasoning provided by the Agents who defined the keyword under that attribute is listed accordingly.\n",

If the reasoning is deemed insufficient, request empirical evidence or present new facts to challenge the Agent's attribute assignment. Additionally, offer your own perspective to prompt Agents to reassess their attribute definitions from alternative angles. Steer and mediate the discussion in a way that encourages critical evaluation, ultimately guiding the Agents toward the most well-founded and accurate attribute assignments.\n",
    "2. In the attribute definitions and rationale provided by each Agent, a '-' has been used to indicate cases where an Agent could not define an attribute for a keyword unrelated to their field. Therefore, unless a definition is explicitly incorrect, the '-' should be maintained to signify the inability to define an attribute.\n",
    "3. If all Agents have assigned appropriate attribute values to the keyword, there is no need to raise any questions. In this case, the question field should be marked with '-'.\n",
    "4. Since the keyword attributes are defined through this process, when analyzing each Agent, carefully identify and evaluate any weaknesses in the attribute definitions with a strict and objective perspective.\n",
    "5. If any of the seven Agents need to revise their attribute definition, raise questions and provide feedback on aspects they may have overlooked, such as specific conditions or concepts, to guide them toward a more accurate attribute definition.\n",
    "6. Carefully review the attribute values and justifications provided by each Agent. Identify any errors in the keyword attribute definition, and if the justification lacks sufficient reasoning, request additional evidence or empirical support. Ensure that the attribute is defined correctly based on valid reasoning.\n",
    "7. If a more meaningful attribute value can be derived than the one defined by the Agent, present it as a question for further consideration.\n",
    "8. When analyzing the attribute definitions assigned by each Agent, the primary consideration should be ensuring that the assigned attribute aligns with the intrinsic meaning of the keyword itself. If the keyword is used differently in the abstract compared to its original meaning, this should be reflected in the attribute assignment. The analysis should focus on whether the assigned attribute is the most appropriate based on this context and whether the reasoning behind the assignment is logically sound. Additionally, any inconsistencies or issues should be identified and questioned accordingly.\n",
    "9. <Important> The primary focus should be on the inherent meaning of the keyword.

Keep this in mind and support each Agent in finding sufficient evidence to define the keyword attribute and clearly explain the reasoning behind their definition.\n",
    "10. For the '7. Topic' attribute, a keyword can be classified under this category when it represents the main subject of the study. Since such keywords can also possess other relevant attributes, they are not limited to the 'Topic' classification alone.

    "1. Assume the role of the assigned Agent among the seven provided Agents and utilize your expertise in the relevant field. Refer to the previous discussion information to select and finalize the most appropriate attribute for the given keyword.\n",
    "2. Each Agent must recall the previously defined attribute value they assigned and use it as a basis to proceed with the following process.\n",
    "3. <Important> Through this process, the attribute of the keyword is ultimately determined. Therefore, each Agent must refer to the previously defined attribute values (previous discussion information) and select the most appropriate attribute from the attributes derived in the previous discussion so that all Agents converge on the same attribute value. However, if, after reviewing all previous attribute definitions and their justifications, an Agent determines that both their own attribute and another Agent's attribute are equally valid, both attributes may be defined. Otherwise, it is preferable to define only one attribute.\n",
    "4. If an Agent previously indicated that the keyword is unrelated to their field by using '-', they should continue to mark it as '-' without defining an attribute, consistently indicating that the keyword is outside their area of expertise.\n",
    "5. When selecting the final attribute, each Agent must provide not only the chosen attribute value but also the reasoning behind its definition.\n",
    "6. When defining an attribute, provide both the classification and a justification. The reasoning must be based on the keyword’s inherent meaning and the abstract, focusing on why the keyword should be assigned to the chosen attribute. The justification should be as detailed as possible, ensuring logical validity and supporting the classification with strong evidence.\n",
    "7. <Important> The primary focus should be on the inherent meaning of the keyword. However, if the abstract reveals that the keyword is used in a different context from its original meaning, attribute classification should not be based on its association with a specific field (\"keyword-field\" relationship). Instead, classification must rely on how the keyword is used and interpreted within the abstract (\"keyword-abstract\" relationship). Therefore, in such cases, the Agent must utilize their domain expertise to analyze how the keyword is described and applied in the abstract. The reasoning for why the keyword should be assigned to a specific attribute must be thoroughly explained and logically justified in the attribute definition. Keep this in mind while redefining the keyword attribute and provide a well-reasoned explanation for the revised classification.\n",
    "8. Agent should classify keyword attributes based on their expertise in the assigned field, but not by considering how the keyword is used or perceived within that field. In other words, attribute classification should focus on the inherent meaning of the keyword itself, rather than its value or application in a specific domain.\n",
    "9. Each of the 1-7 Agents represents a broad category, so sub-field experts should be assigned within each Agent. These sub-field experts must engage in discussions to determine the most appropriate attribute classification, which will then be established as the final attribute classification for that Agent. For example, in the case of the '1. Natural Science Expert' Agent, experts in physics, astronomy, meteorology, chemistry, geology, and geophysics possess extensive knowledge in their respective domains. Therefore, after discussions among these specialists, the most suitable attribute classification should be determined and set as the final classification for the '1. Natural Science Expert' Agent.\n",
    "10. For the '7. Topic' attribute, a keyword can be classified under this category when it represents the main subject of the study. Since such keywords can also possess other relevant attributes, they are not limited to the 'Topic' classification alone. Therefore, it is important to note that 'Topic' is the only attribute that can be defined alongside another attribute.\n",
    "11. <Important> Except for \"7. Topic,\" no attribute should have overlapping definitions. Only the most suitable attribute should be selected.\n",
    "12. When classifying attributes, note that observed and examined \"phenomena\" fall under the Processes & Reactions attribute, whereas observed and measured \"results\" are classified under Properties & Characteristics. For example, terms such as \"Boiling,\" \"Evaporation,\" \"Molecular binding,\" and \"Thermal expansion\" belong to Processes & Reactions, while \"boiling point,\" \"vapor pressure,\" \"binding energy,\" and \"coefficient of thermal expansion\" fall under Properties & Characteristics. Carefully analyze these characteristics when determining the appropriate attribute for a given keyword.\n",
    "13. Similar keywords may have different attributes depending on their prefixes and suffixes. Therefore, consider both the prefix, suffix, and overall meaning of the keyword when defining its attribute.\n",
    "14. Since the seven Agents must discuss and agree on a single attribute for a given keyword, a broad range of opinions cannot be accommodated. Therefore, each Agent should critically analyze both their own attribute definition and those of other Agents to determine and adopt the most appropriate attribute. If feedback suggests that another Agent’s attribute definition is more meaningful and yields a better classification, the Agent should remove their initial attribute definition. However, there is no obligation to fully agree with another Agent’s opinion. Instead, the Agent should compare and analyze their own perspective against those of others and select the most factually accurate and meaningful conclusion as the basis for the final decision.\n",
    "15. Attribute classification must strictly define the primary attribute of the keyword. Do not provide auxiliary or secondary attributes.\n",
    "16. The generated output must strictly follow the structure below. No unnecessary content should be included beyond this format, and responses must adhere precisely to the specified structure. (Insert the assigned Agent name in \"OOO\" and replace \"~~~\" with the appropriate values.)\n",

XPS was conducted to examine the surface composition and electronic structure changes of the CNT-Pd catalyst before and after gas treatment. The XPS results revealed that as-prepared CNT-Pd contains at least two different oxidation states on the surface, whereon their proportions depend on the gas used for treatment. Treatment with Hz leads to Pd(0) enrichment near the surface, while Oz treatment causes Pd(II) enrichment of CNT-Pd. All catalysts containing both Pd(0) and Pd(II) were active toward H2O2 reduction, and the Heck cross-coupling reaction of n-butyl acrylate and 4-iodo- toluene; increased proportion of metallic Pd(0) boosted the catalytic reaction. However, the catalyst stability increased as the amount of Pd(II) increased.\n",
